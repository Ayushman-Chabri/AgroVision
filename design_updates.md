**System Flow (Designed by Ayushman)**-: 0. Access region
[Edge Case-:Border District -> Handling-: Focus only on central areas during demo]
0.1> Set Default Language
0.2> Set District (Location is hardcoded/GPS use)
0.3> Initialize voice model and greet(In all preferred languages and proceed as per farmer input)
0.4> Give options for Modes(pre-cropping/cropping/post-cropping)
**If precropping**-: 1. Collect all inputs
1.1> Collect crop names
[Edge Cases-:
Crop is not available in the database | Handling-> Only focus on crops that are present during demo
User's audio is not comprehendable-: Ask to repeat
]

            1.2> Collect Land area
            [Edge Cases-:
            Land area unit is comprehendable | Handling -> Gemma and only those units that we are sure that they exist

        3. Based on yield of crop per unit area and variety of seeds      *Add this detail to soil database*
           3.1 Multiply with Land area and find revenue

        4. Subtract the investment from revenue and calculate net value
           4.1> If net value>0:
                        Indicate Profit

            5.2> If loss, suggest special policies in addition to 5.1 if any and recommend referral( for freeloader policies and overall advice)

        ** If cropping **-:
        1. Ask the farmer about problem
        2. If the problem is-:
                             within the list:[Problems not related to the crop itself]:            *Decide this list later*
                                  Refer to techniques
                             if the problem is a crop disease:
                                  a> Activate photo module
                                      a.1> Check the photo and identify the disease using Vision model(based on symptoms)
                                           If disease identified:
                                                          Suggest remedies and referral
                                           If not identified:
                                                          Suggest referrals only

        ** If post cropping **-:
        1. Ask the farmer his yield
        2. Ask the farmer about his further decisions(whether wants to sale, or is unsatisfied with yield)
           If unsatisfied with yield:
                 Recommend suitable referrals and policies
           If wants to sale:
                 Recommend suitable referrals and policies
